Organizations handle team collaboration, security settings, and billing.\n🔹 Projects → Each AI model (e.g., a chatbot or GenAI assistant) is managed under a project. Projects define business rules, safety checks, and testing workflows.💡 Example:\nA company working on multiple AI assistants (one for customer support and one for internal knowledge) would create two separate projects under the same organization.","-aiandme-in-action#🔍 AIandMe in Action":"AIandMe applies advanced security techniques to help teams test, refine, and protect AI applications at different stages:","1️⃣-development-phase-ai-testing--security#1️⃣ Development Phase: AI Testing & Security":"Before deploying your AI, AIandMe helps you test it under real-world conditions.✅ Adversarial Prompt Testing → Runs automated stress tests against your model.\n✅ LLM-as-a-Judge (from your article) → Uses AI itself to evaluate AI-generated responses.\n✅ Iterative Refinement → Helps fine-tune model responses based on security insights.","2️⃣-production-phase-real-time-protection#2️⃣ Production Phase: Real-Time Protection":"Once your AI is live, AIandMe monitors and filters user prompts to prevent unintended behavior.✅ AI Firewall (from your second article) → Detects risky or out-of-scope queries and blocks them in real time.\n✅ Fine-Tuning Support → Uses insights from penetration testing to continuously improve the AI model.\n✅ LLM Oversight → Ensures AI doesn’t hallucinate or provide misleading answers.","3️⃣-post-deployment-ai-auditing--monitoring#3️⃣ Post-Deployment: AI Auditing & Monitoring":"Even after deployment, AIandMe provides continuous security & compliance checks.✅ Regular Log Audits → Reviews past conversations to identify patterns of AI misbehavior.\n✅ Enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge → Evaluates past AI outputs for bias, security issues, and compliance violations.\n✅ Human Expert Review → Helps teams manually inspect flagged AI responses.","-why-use-aiandme#🚀 Why Use AIandMe?":"🔹 Protect AI from misuse – Ensure AI follows ethical and business rules.\n🔹 Catch problems early – Identify AI vulnerabilities before they cause harm.\n🔹 Automate security & compliance – Reduce manual work with AI-driven evaluations.","-next-steps#🔗 Next Steps":"⚡ Quick Start Guide\n🔌 Connect a Model Provider\n🛠️ Creating a Project\n\n💡 Need help?
