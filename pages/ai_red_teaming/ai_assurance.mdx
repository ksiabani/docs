# üõ°Ô∏è AI Assurance

ai+me provides **end-to-end AI assurance** that goes beyond simple runtime filtering. Our platform combines **automated adversarial testing**, **behavioral QA**, **real-time firewalls**, and **post-production analysis** to deliver comprehensive security coverage tailored to your AI's actual business context.

## üéØ What is AI Assurance?

AI assurance is the systematic process of ensuring that AI systems are **safe**, **reliable**, **secure**, and **compliant** throughout their entire lifecycle. Unlike traditional security approaches that focus only on runtime protection, AI assurance encompasses:

- **Pre-production testing** to identify vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Real-time monitoring** to protect against threats during operation
- **Post-production analysis** to detect emergent risks and improve security
- **Continuous improvement** through feedback loops and iterative testing

## üèóÔ∏è The AI Assurance Lifecycle

ai+me's AI assurance approach covers the entire AI lifecycle:
