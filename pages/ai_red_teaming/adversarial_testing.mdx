# 🔥 Adversarial Testing

ai+me's adversarial testing simulates **real-world attacks** against your AI systems to identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Unlike generic security testing, our approach generates **contextual attacks** tailored to your AI's specific business scope and use cases.

## 🎯 What is Adversarial Testing?

Adversarial testing is a **systematic approach** to identifying vulnerabilities in AI systems by simulating malicious attacks. Think of it as **penetration testing for AI**—we systematically test your AI's boundaries and identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.

### 🔍 **Key Concepts**

#### **Contextual Attacks**

- **Purpose**: Generate attacks relevant to your AI's business context
- **Method**: Create prompts based on your specific use cases and scope
- **Goal**: Identify vulnerabilities that matter for your application

#### **Systematic Testing**

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive coverage of potential attack vectors
- **Method**: Structured testing against known vulnerability categories
- **Goal**: Ensure no attack vectors are overlooked

#### **Automated Evaluation**

- **Purpose**: Consistent and scalable vulnerability assessment
- **Method**: Use LLM-as-a-Judge to evaluate AI responses
- **Goal**: Provide objective, repeatable results

## 🏗️ How Adversarial Testing Works

### 🔄 **Testing Process**

#### **Step 1: Context Analysis**

1. **Business Scope Review**: Analyze your AI's intended use cases
2. **Policy Extraction**: Identify security policies and constraints
3. **Risk Assessment**: Determine potential attack vectors
4. **Scope Definition**: Define testing boundaries and objectives

#### **Step 2: Attack Generation**

1. **Pattern Creation**: Generate attack patterns based on context
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Create adversarial prompts
3. **Edge Case Identification**: Identify boundary conditions
4. **Attack Variation**: Create multiple attack variations

#### **Step 3: Test Execution**

1. **Automated Testing**: Run attacks against your AI system
2. **Response Collection**: Capture AI responses to attacks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track system performance during testing
4. **Error Handling**: Manage test failures and timeouts

#### **Step 4: Response Evaluation**

1. **Safety Assessment**: Evaluate responses for safety violations
2. **Policy Compliance**: Check adherence to business policies
3. **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify specific vulnerabilities
4. **Risk Scoring**: Assign risk scores to identified issues

#### **Step 5: Reporting and Analysis**

1. **Vulnerability Reports**: Generate detailed vulnerability reports
2. **Risk Assessment**: Provide comprehensive risk analysis
3. **Remediation Guidance**: Suggest specific fixes and improvements
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track vulnerabilities over time
