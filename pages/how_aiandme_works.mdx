# How AIandMe Works  

AIandMe is a **platform for testing, evaluating, and securing LLM-based applications**.  
It helps developers ensure that AI models are **safe, aligned with business goals, and free from vulnerabilities** at every stage—**development, production, and post-deployment**.

---

## **🛠️ AIandMe Structure**
AIandMe follows a **simple structure** based on **organizations** and **projects**:

🔹 **Organization** → The top-level management unit. Organizations handle **team collaboration, security settings, and billing**.  
🔹 **Projects** → Each AI model (e.g., a chatbot or GenAI assistant) is managed under a project. Projects define **business rules, safety checks, and testing workflows**.

**Example:**  
A company working on multiple AI assistants (one for customer support and one for internal knowledge) would create **two separate projects** under the same organization.

## **🔍 AIandMe in Action**
AIandMe applies **advanced security techniques** to help teams **test, refine, and protect AI applications** at different stages:

### **1️. Development Phase: AI Testing & Security**
Before deploying your AI, AIandMe helps you **test it under real-world conditions**.

✅ **Adversarial Prompt Testing** → Runs automated stress tests against your model.  
✅ **LLM-as-a-Judge** (from your article) → Uses AI itself to **evaluate AI-generated responses**.  
✅ **Iterative Refinement** → Helps fine-tune model responses based on security insights.  

---

### **2️. Production Phase: Real-Time Protection**
Once your AI is live, AIandMe **monitors and filters user prompts** to **prevent unintended behavior**.

✅ **AI Firewall** (from your second article) → Detects **risky or out-of-scope queries** and blocks them in real time.  
✅ **Fine-Tuning Support** → Uses insights from penetration testing to **continuously improve the AI model**.  
✅ **LLM Oversight** → Ensures AI doesn’t **hallucinate or provide misleading answers**.  

---

### **3️. Post-Deployment: AI Auditing & Monitoring**
Even after deployment, AIandMe provides **continuous security & compliance checks**.

✅ **Regular Log Audits** → Reviews past conversations to **identify patterns of AI misbehavior**.  
✅ **Enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge** → Evaluates past AI outputs for **bias, security issues, and compliance violations**.  
✅ **Human Expert Review** → Helps teams manually inspect flagged AI responses.
