# ü§ñ MCP Server Integration

The ai+me Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides a standardized interface that allows any compatible AI model or agent to access ai+me's comprehensive AI security testing capabilities in a simple and secure way.

You can connect to our MCP server natively through compatible clients such as Claude Desktop and Cursor. Our MCP server is centrally hosted and managed, providing tools to:

- **Create and manage experiments** for AI security testing
- **Execute comprehensive security assessments** against your AI systems
- **Retrieve detailed test results** and vulnerability reports
- **Monitor experiment status** in real-time
- **Manage projects and configurations** programmatically

## üîë Getting Your API Key

Before setting up the MCP server connection, you need to create an API key in your ai+me account:

### **Step 1: Access API Keys Settings**

1. **Navigate to Settings**: Go to your ai+me dashboard
2. **Open API Keys**: Click on **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
3. **View API Keys**: You'll see a list of your existing API keys (if any)

### **Step 2: Create a New API Key**

1. **Click "Create API Key"**: Use the button in the API Keys section
2. **Enter Key Name**: Provide a descriptive name (e.g., "MCP Server Integration")
   - **Maximum 50 characters**
   - **Use a clear, descriptive name**
3. **Create Key**: Click "Create" to generate your API key
4. **Copy the Key**: The API key will be displayed once - copy it immediately
   - **Important**: You won't be able to see the full key again
   - **Store it securely**: Use a password manager or secure storage

### **Step 3: Use Your API Key**

- **Format**: Your API key will be a long string of characters
- **Authentication**: Use it in the `Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>` header
- **Security**: Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

Remote MCP connections are still in early development, and you may experience connection issues that require multiple attempts. If you encounter problems:

1. **Restart your client application**
2. **Disable and re-enable** the ai+me MCP server
3. **Check your internet connection** and firewall settings
4. **Verify your authentication token** is valid and active
5. **Ask for help** in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PSHCDz93xW)
