# AIandMe Platform Documentation

Welcome to the AIandMe platform documentation. This guide will help you understand and use our platform to ensure the safety, security, and accuracy of your AI applications. AIandMe is designed for teams that care about user trust and ethical AI deployment. Whether you're in development, production, or post-deployment phases, our tools have you covered.

## Overview

The AIandMe platform consists of three main components:

### 1. Contextual Penetration Testing (Development Phase)

Identify vulnerabilities during the development phase using synthetic adversarial prompts and industry-standard security practices.

- **Synthetic Adversarial Prompts:** Automatically generated prompts designed to probe potential weaknesses.
- **LLM-as-a-Judge:** Evaluates AI responses to uncover vulnerabilities and explain successful attacks.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Human expertise and iterative testing to improve the AI system's guardrails.

### 2. Real-Time Protection (Production Phase)

Protect your AI system in real-time by detecting and blocking out-of-scope intents.

- **Optimized LLM Evaluator:** Monitors user prompts and identifies risks outside expected business operations.
- **Fine-Tuning Capability:** Leverage insights from penetration testing to continuously refine the evaluator.

### 3. Asynchronous Auditing (Post-Deployment Phase)

Ensure ongoing reliability and compliance by auditing production logs and user interactions.

- **Regularly Scheduled Audits:** Analyze logs to detect unexpected responses or behaviors.
- **Enhanced LLM-as-a-Judge:** Combines insights from prior phases to evaluate interactions.
- **Human Expertise:** Experts review findings to further strengthen safeguards.
