2. Find your completed experiment (status will show "Finished")
3. Click on the experiment name to view detailed results

### 4.2 Overview Dashboard

The **Overview** tab provides a comprehensive summary with key insights:

#### **📈 Performance Metrics Dashboard**

**Core Metrics:**

- **Total Performance Index (TPI)**: Comprehensive performance score (0-100)
- **Reliability Score**: Statistical confidence in test results (90%+ is high confidence)
- **Fail Impact**: Assessment of the severity and potential impact of failed tests
- **Pass Rate**: Percentage of tests your AI handled correctly (with risk level indicators)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of tests that resulted in technical errors

**Metrics are color-coded by risk level:**

- **🟢 Green**: Excellent performance (Pass Rate ≥95%, Error Rate ≤5%)
- **🔵 Blue**: Good performance (Pass Rate 85-94%, Error Rate 6-15%)
- **🟠 Orange**: Fair performance (Pass Rate 70-84%, Error Rate 16-30%)
- **🔴 Red**: Poor performance (Pass Rate < 70%, Error Rate >30%)

#### **📊 Test Results by Category**

View detailed breakdown by security category:

- **Risk Category (Threat)**: Specific vulnerability type tested
- **Risk Level**: Risk assessment (High, Medium, Low)
- **Failed Tests**: Number of tests that failed in each risk category
- **Security Framework Mapping**: Mappings to security frameworks like the OWASP LLM Top 10

#### **💡 AI-Powered Insights**

- **Security Insights**: AI-generated analysis of vulnerabilities found
- **Severity Assessment**: Risk levels with detailed explanations

### 4.4 Understanding Your Results

#### **✅ Passed Tests (Green)**

- **Meaning**: Your AI handled the scenario correctly and securely
- **Security Status**: No vulnerabilities detected for this test case
- **Action**: Document as acceptable behavior pattern
- **Confidence**: High reliability when pass rate is ≥95%

#### **❌ Failed Tests (Red)**

- **Meaning**: Potential security vulnerability or inappropriate response detected
- **Risk Levels**:
  - **High Severity**: Critical security issues requiring immediate attention
  - **Medium Severity**: Important issues that should be addressed
  - **Low Severity**: Minor concerns for future consideration
- **Action Required**: Review prompt, response, and AI explanation
- **Next Steps**: Implement fixes based on specific recommendations

#### **⚠️ Error Tests (Gray)**

- **Meaning**: Technical issues during test execution
- **Common Causes**:
  - API connection timeouts
  - Invalid responses from your AI system
  - Configuration or authentication problems
- **Action**: Check integration settings and API connectivity
- **Impact**: High error rates (>30%) indicate system issues
