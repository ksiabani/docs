# 🐙 GitHub Integration

ai+me integrates seamlessly with **GitHub Actions** to bring AI security testing into your CI/CD pipeline. This enables **automated security validation** of your AI applications on every pull request, ensuring that code changes don't introduce security vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## 🎯 What is GitHub Integration?

GitHub integration with ai+me allows you to **automatically trigger experiments** when code changes are made, providing:

- **🔒 Automated Security Testing**: Run AI security tests on every PR
- **🚀 Early Vulnerability Detection**: Catch security issues before deployment
- **📊 Continuous Compliance**: Maintain security standards across all changes
- **🔄 Seamless Workflow**: Integrate security testing into existing CI/CD processes

## 🚀 Setting Up GitHub Integration

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Experiment**

Before setting up GitHub integration, you need a **configured experiment** in ai+me:

1. **Create an Experiment**: Set up your AI security testing experiment
2. **Test Manually**: Run the experiment manually to verify it works
3. **Note Integration Details**: You'll need the experiment endpoint URL

### **Step 2: Access Integration Settings**

1. **Navigate to Your Experiment**: Go to your experiment in ai+me
2. **Open Settings**: Click on the **Settings** tab
3. **Select Integration**: Choose the **Integration** sub-tab
4. **View Integration Details**: You'll see the endpoint URL and GitHub Action example

### **Step 3: Get Required Information**

From the experiment integration page, you'll need:

#### **Experiment Endpoint URL**

- **Location**: Displayed prominently on the integration page
- **Format**: `https://api.aiandme.io/experiments/{experiment-id}`

#### **Project API Key**

- **Location**: Link to project settings from the integration page
- **Path**: `/projects/{project-id}/settings/integration`

### **Step 4: Create GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a `.github/workflows/aiandme-security.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: AIandMe Security Testing
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  security-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: AI Security Testing
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run AI Security Experiment
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_API_KEY }}
          ENDPOINT_URL: ${{ secrets.EXPERIMENT_CLONE_ENDPOINT }}
          PROVIDER_ID: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_ID }}
        run: |
          echo "🚀 Triggering AI security experiment..."

          # Trigger the experiment
          response=$(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -X POST "$ENDPOINT_URL" \
            -H "x-api-key: $API_KEY" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "provider_id": "$PROVIDER_ID"
            }')

          # Extract status code and response body
          http_code="${response: -3}"
          response_body="${response%???}"

          if [ "$http_code" -eq 200 ] || [ "$http_code" -eq 201 ]; then
            echo "✅ Experiment triggered successfully"
            echo "📊 Check your AIandMe dashboard for results and insights"
          else
            echo "❌ Failed to trigger experiment (HTTP $http_code)"
            echo "Response: $response_body"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Comment on PR
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: '🔒 AI security testing has been triggered. Check your [AIandMe dashboard](https://app.aiandme.io) for results and insights.'
            })
```
