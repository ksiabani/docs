# 🏢 Projects

Projects are the **foundational organizational unit** in ai+me that define the scope, boundaries, and security parameters of your AI applications. Think of a project as a **container** that holds everything related to testing and securing a specific AI system—from experiments and firewall logs to analytics and insights.

## 🎯 What is a Project in ai+me?

A project in ai+me represents a **complete AI application or system** that you want to test and secure. It serves as the central hub for:

- **🔒 Security Testing**: Running experiments to identify vulnerabilities
- **🛡️ Firewall Protection**: Monitoring and blocking unsafe requests
- **📊 Analytics**: Tracking performance, pass rates, and security metrics
- **📋 Scope Management**: Defining what your AI should and shouldn't do
- **🧪 Experiment Organization**: Managing multiple test scenarios

## 🚀 Creating Your First Project

### **Step 1: Access Project Creation**

1. Navigate to your **ai+me Dashboard**
2. Click **"Create Project"** button in the top right
3. Or use the **"Start with a Template"** section for quick setup

### **Step 2: Basic Project Information**

Fill in the essential project details:

#### **Project Name**

- Choose a descriptive, memorable name
- Example: `"Customer Support Chatbot"`, `"E-commerce AI Assistant"`
- **Best Practice**: Use clear, business-focused names

#### **Description**

- Provide a brief overview of your AI's purpose
- Example: `"AI-powered customer support system for our e-commerce platform"`
- **Character Limit**: 255 characters

### **Step 3: Define Your Business Scope**

The business scope is the **foundation** of your project. It defines what your AI does and its intended use cases.

#### **What to Include in Business Scope:**

- **Primary Function**: What is the main purpose of your AI?
- **Target Users**: Who will interact with your AI?
- **Use Cases**: What specific tasks should your AI handle?
- **Platform/Context**: Where and how will your AI be used?
- **Business Rules**: Any specific guidelines or constraints?

#### **Example Business Scope:**

```
Our customer support chatbot helps users with product inquiries, order status,
and basic troubleshooting. It operates within our e-commerce platform and
provides helpful, accurate information while maintaining a professional tone.
The chatbot handles common customer questions, processes basic requests, and
escalates complex issues to human agents when necessary.
```

### **Step 4: Define Allowed Intents**

Allowed intents specify what your AI **should be able to do** within its scope.

#### **Example Allowed Intents:**

```
- Answer questions about product features and specifications
- Check order status and provide tracking information
- Help with basic account management (password reset, profile updates)
- Provide troubleshooting steps for common technical issues
- Direct users to appropriate human support channels
- Explain return and refund policies
- Share general company information and contact details
```

### **Step 5: Define Restricted Intents**

Restricted intents specify what your AI **should never do** or topics it should avoid.

#### **Example Restricted Intents:**

```
- Access or modify user payment information or financial data
- Provide medical, legal, or financial advice
- Share internal company data, trade secrets, or confidential information
- Generate harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content
- Perform actions outside the e-commerce platform scope
- Access user personal data beyond what's necessary for support
- Make promises about product availability or delivery times
- Provide technical support for issues outside our platform
```

### **Step 6: Scope Analysis**

Click **"Analyze"** to let ai+me process your configuration. This critical step:

#### **What Analysis Does:**

- ✅ **Processes your input**: Analyzes the information you provided
- ✅ **Removes redundancies**: Eliminates duplicate or unnecessary content
- ✅ **Structures the data**: Converts your input into a clean, organized list format
- ✅ **Prepares for review**: Creates a refined version for your approval

### **Step 7: Review and Create**

After analysis, review the results and click **"Create Project"**. Your project is now ready for experiments!
