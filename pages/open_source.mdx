# 🔓 Open Source

ai+me maintains an open source library that implements a **contextual firewall** for LLM-based applications using the `LLM-as-a-judge` concept. This library helps safeguard your AI systems from unintended prompts such as jailbreaking attempts, malicious inputs, and other security threats.

## 🛡️ AIandMe FirewallOSS

The [AIandMe FirewallOSS](https://github.com/aiandme-io/firewall) is an open-source library that acts as a middleware layer to contextually filter and validate user prompts. It ensures that AI agents adhere to their intended business scope and operational boundaries through a reflection approach where an LLM acts as a judge.

### **Key Features**

- **Scope Validation**: Ensures user prompts align with the AI agent's defined business scope
- **Intent Filtering**: Allows only prompts that match predefined permitted intents
- **Restricted Action Blocking**: Blocks prompts that attempt to trigger restricted actions
- **Two-Step Assessment**: Initial quick decision followed by detailed explanation for efficiency
- **Multiple LLM Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI and Azure OpenAI (with more providers coming soon)

### **How It Works**

The library operates in two asynchronous steps for low latency:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Quickly delivers a decision regarding the three categories: `off_topic`, `violation`, or `restriction`
2. **Explanation**: Provides a detailed explanation of the verdict using streaming capabilities

The library **does not function as a proxy** - instead, it analyzes user prompts and provides flags indicating potential issues. It's the responsibility of the LLM application developer to determine how to handle flagged prompts based on their specific requirements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install aiandme
```

The library supports both self-hosting with your own LLM providers and integration with the ai+me platform for enhanced features and logging capabilities.

## 📄 License

The AIandMe FirewallOSS library is released under the MIT license, making it free for both personal and commercial use.
