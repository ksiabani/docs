# 🔌 Setting Up Model Providers

AIandMe allows you to **integrate your own model provider** as an evaluator using the **LLM-as-a-Judge** concept. This means you can use a **custom LLM** (such as OpenAI or Azure OpenAI) to analyze **user prompts** and decide whether they align with your application's expected behavior.

AIandMe classifies each prompt as:  
✅ **Pass** → The input aligns with the AI assistant’s intended use.  
❌ **Fail** → The input is out of scope and should be blocked.

## **🔗 Supported Model Providers**
Currently, AIandMe supports:  
- **OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, etc.)**  
- **Azure OpenAI**  
- **More providers coming soon!**  

You can configure any of these as your **LLM judge** to power the AIandMe Firewall.
